This project was created as part of my chance to get a test interview for Remote Coding Assignment.

In this project I made 3 pages, namely: Home Page, View Transactions, Detail Balance Aggregator

# Home Pages:
There are 5 sections on this home page, namely:
1. The title with the transaction button icon, when the user clicks the transaction button icon, will be directed to the transaction page
2. Wallet with text that contains information on the user's total balance and 2 main menus that users often do, namely Transfer and Request
3. Menu list which is a feature of the application
4. Information and promo banners
5. List of transaction history, when the user clicks the text "See all" it will be directed to the Transaction page and when the user clicks on one of the transaction list items it will be directed to the balance aggregator detail page

# View Transactions
Contains a list of user transaction history where when the user clicks on a transaction item it will be redirected to the balance aggregator detail page

# Detail Balance Aggregator
Contains details of balance aggregator based on transactions that have been previously selected or the user can choose as desired in the "Select Sample" or "Select Account" dropdown section
